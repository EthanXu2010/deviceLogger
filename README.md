===========================

-THE LOGGER-SECURE.PY SCRIPT WILL TURN THE VIDEO AND LOGS INTO MY .ESECURE FILE, YOU WILL NEED TO DECRYPT IT USING THE DECRYPT.PY SCRIPT-
-IT IS RECOMMENDED TO CHANGE THE SECRET KEY THATS 32-BYTE VALUE ENCODED IN BASE64, I.E.

Fernet.generate_key()

-THE KEY IS SAVED AS A SECRET_KEY VARIABLE IN ALL THE PYTHON SCRIPTS-

=====================================================================

-PASSWORD SECURITY IN DECRYPT.PY-
    *THE CURRENT VERSION WILL ASK YOU FOR THE FIRST PASSWORD
    *THERE IS NO SET VALUE FOR THE FIRST PASSWORD, THOUGH IT HAS TO START WITH 2010 AND END WITH 0130(CHANGABLE)
    *THE SECOND PASSWORD IS THE MIDDLE PART OF PASSWORD A(2010******0130), THAT YOU ENTERED ENCODED IN BASE64
    *SO IF YOU ENTERED 2010h0130, THE SECOND PASSWORD WILL BE aA==
    *IF THIS IS TOO COMPLICATED, THE DECRYPTION METHOD IS IN THE CODE, YOU CAN ASK CHATGPT TO CHANGE IT INTO A DIFFERENT SECURITY METHOD

=========================================================================================================================================

-THE VIDEO GIVEN TO YOU HAS THE REAL-TIME TIME, AND REAL-TIME SCRIPT ADDED INTO IT-
-THE VIDEO IS SPED UP BECAUSE OF A BUG I AM TRYING TO FIX-
-FOR DECRYPT.PY TO WORK YOU HAVE TO DRAG THE SESSION.ESECURE FILE INTO THE SAME DIRECTORY AS DECRYPT.PY-
-THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES AND SECURITY USES ONLY-
    *DO NOT FOR ANY REASON INSTALL THIS ON SOMEONE ELSE`S COMPUTER WITHOUT PERMISSION
